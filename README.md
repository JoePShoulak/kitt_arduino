# KITT Arduino Project

This project targets the **Arduino GIGA R1** with the GIGA Display Shield.

## Required Libraries

- **Arduino_USBHostMbed5** (installed with the GIGA board package)
- **I2S** (bundled with the board package)

Install the `Arduino GIGA R1` board support via the IDE's **Board Manager**. The
above libraries are included automatically.

## Building

Open the `kitt.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE and select the **Arduino GIGA R1**
board. Compile and upload as usual.
